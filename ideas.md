Here are some ideas I'd like to build (or fund) some day. If you know any existing products which are good enough, let me know. I would support them as a customer right away.

## WiFi routers with an app store

Routers are always-on, general-purpose computers which are woefully underutilized in an average home. It should be as easy to run "server" apps at home as it is to install apps on your smartphone. 

## Music Stick

Only a tiny proportion of people who'd like to learn a string instruments like guitar, actually get started. Besides the usual reasons like procrastination, two biggest factors are: Difficulty and Cost. Piano, because of the way it separates the diatonic scale notes from the rest, is very easy to learn. Acoustic guitars are also bulky by definition. I have had the idea of creating a diatonic-only, 3-string, music stick that would make music as easy to learn as a piano, and would be cheap enough that every single family could afford it as a birthday gift. Andy Mackie used to make this kind of music sticks and give away to children.

## Cooking robot

This will save immense number of hours and amount of money that families spend in kitchen (especially, if you include rent). Some day, this will be looked at the way we now look at washing machines and dishwashers.

## Computers made for programmers

Programmers have to work with multiple operating systems, and hackintosh-like computers with all 3 OSes pre-installed and fully functional will find a ready market.

## A Patreon-clone but one that supports recurring UPI

In India, there are many more UPI users than there are card holders. This matters to creators & artists who rely on tiny recurring donations from a wide base. No one seems to have built it so far.

## GoodReads, but for all kind of media

Update: I am helping build this at https://learnawesome.org

In last 10 years, I have started seeing myself as a "learner" rather than a "reader". Books are just one type of media, and if your goal is to learn, you should make use of all kind of great content: videos, podcasts, meetups, livestreams, interactive explorables etc.
