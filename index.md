Hi. Iâ€™m an engineer, specializing in web & mobile software, with experience in data science, hardware, blockchains and physics/mathematics. After my engineering & MBA, I have worked with tech startups in roles as diverse as co-founder, engineering, and product management for almost 12 years. Here is my (outdated) resume.

I am based in Bangalore (India) and work for ClearTax. I maintain a list of my current projects. You can see some of my past work here or at GitHub and contact me.

I also like to make music and learn new things.
