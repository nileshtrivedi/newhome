You should check out [my current projects](/now).

I started programming in 1999. Starting with C, I finished many projects with Java and Javascript before discovering and falling in love with Ruby. I co-founded a B2B startup (YouSuggest.us which was a social CRM app) and learnt a lot. The companies I have worked with include GupShup, Truweight, HyperTrack, and ClearTax among others. My skills range from web & mobile apps to electronics hardware to machine learning or algorithmic trading to topics like syllogisms, aerodynamics and mathematics behind music theory. My [resume](/Nilesh_Trivedi_CV.pdf) is here.
