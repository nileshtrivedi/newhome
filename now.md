I currently do engineering at [ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/){:target='_blank'} (YCombinator S14), where our goal is to simplify financial lives of consumers and businesses in India. Taxes, investments, and finance are hard but ClearTax is building some really good solutions in this domain.

I am also part of a few communities. Some of us started [LearnAwesome.Org](https://learnawesome.org/){:target='_blank'} where we are building humanity's universal learning map by collecting the best learning resources from the Web on various topics. Then, there is the blockchain developer community, [Indium.Network](https://indium.network/){:target='_blank'}, who are building a optimized-for-dapps blockchain. Another initiative is [Polyglot.Network](https://polyglot.network){:target='_blank'} which will be an open-source software development agency. And finally, along with a few recreational mathematics enthusiasts, we're trying to build the first ever mathematics museum in India.

On the music-making front, things have slowed down a bit since I moved to Bangalore, although, I did start playing the keyboard recently. Watching [Pehla Nasha cover by Chetan Ghodeshwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqXsIY9Sp0){:target='_blank'} is what gave me the final nudge. BlackStratBlues continues to be the favorite. I have also started enjoying Led Zeppelin and Queen a lot more.
