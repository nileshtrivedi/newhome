I currently run engineering at [ClearTax](https://cleartax.in/){:target='_blank'} (YCombinator S14), where our goal is to simplify financial lives of consumers and businesses in India. Taxes, investments, and finance are hard but ClearTax is building some really good solutions in this domain. I'm having a lot of fun building things on the consumer front for them.

I am also part of a few communities. Some of us started [LearnAwesome.Org](https://learnawesome.org/){:target='_blank'} where we are building humanity's universal learning map by collecting the best learning resources from the Web on various topics.  Another initiative is [Polyglot.Network](https://polyglot.network){:target='_blank'} which will be an open-source software development agency. And then there is [DhiMath](http://dhimath.org/) where a few recreational mathematics enthusiasts in Bengaluru are trying to build the first ever mathematics museum in India with both physical and interactive exhibits. We hold meetups almost every weekend in Cubbon Park, Lal Bagh and other venues. You should come as it's a lot of fun!

On the music-making front, I started playing the keyboard recently. Watching [Pehla Nasha cover by Chetan Ghodeshwar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlqXsIY9Sp0){:target='_blank'} is what gave me the final nudge. BlackStratBlues continues to be the favorite. I have also started enjoying Led Zeppelin and Queen a lot more.
