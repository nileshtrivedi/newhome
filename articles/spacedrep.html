    <h1>Spaced repetition for the entire Web?</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="https://learnawesome.org/topics/b874168f-6c52-408b-a93a-6dbf07ee4ec7-spaced-repetition" target="_blank">Spaced repetition</a>,
        when embedded <i>within</i> the content you're reading, is extraordinarily effective for not just improving
        retention but also conceptual understanding of complex topics. Try that yourself with  
        <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/" target="_blank">Nicky Case's interactive about spaced-repetition itself</a> and 
        <a href="https://quantum.country" target="_blank">Michael Nielson and Andy Matuschak's series about Quantum Mechanics</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I built a <a href="https://github.com/learn-awesome/flashcard" target="_blank">reusable component</a> that allows Web authors
        to embed sets of flashcards (question-answer pairs) within their writing, but that stores users'
        progress in the browser's <code>localStorage</code>. With this, anyone can create content in a &quot;mnemonic medium&quot; like the 
        above two articles. Authors don't need to <i>write code</i> or use a third-part server, and users
        don't need to <i>download apps</i>. Ideally, I wanted to build <code>&lt;card-set&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;flash-card&gt;</code>
        as standard HTML custom elements - which would have been easier to use, and also allowed questions and answers to be arbitrary HTML
        (pictures, math, audio or video clips etc), but due to
        the limitations of VueJS and WebComponents, this is the best I could do for now. Improvements are welcome!

        I earlier <a href="https://medium.com/learn-awesome/practice-what-you-learn-using-learnawesome-orgs-flashcards-3343d57a33b0" target="_blank">
        built a FlashCard-module</a> in <a href="https://learnawesome.org" target="_blank">LearnAwesome.org</a> with two features that 
        I think are very cool: (a) A <b>browser-extension that infers the question from the text surrounding the <i>answer</i></b> and lets you 
        quickly create a flashcard about something you want to remember
        from your online reading and (b) <b>a tool that can bulk-create flashcards from your notes</b>, thus helping you remember things from
        non-textual or offline learning: videos, meetings, conferences etc. This new component should make it even more easier for
        online writers to adopt SRS.

    <h2>Demo:</h2>

    <p>There are 10 levels, and a card moves to next level if recall is working after 2^level days. But for this demo, that factor has been 
      scaled to 2^level <i>seconds</i>.
    </p>

    <div id="cardset1">
        <card-set timeunit="seconds"></card-set>
    </div>

    <script>
    new Vue({
      el: '#cardset1',
      data: {
