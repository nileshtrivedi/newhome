    <h1>Spaced repetition for the entire Web?</h1>

    <p>
        <a href="https://learnawesome.org/topics/b874168f-6c52-408b-a93a-6dbf07ee4ec7-spaced-repetition" target="_blank">Spaced repetition</a>,
        when embedded <i>within</i> the content you're reading, is extraordinarily effective for not just improving
        retention but also conceptual understanding of complex topics. Try that yourself with  
        <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/" target="_blank">Nicky Case's interactive about spaced-repetition itself</a> and 
        <a href="https://quantum.country" target="_blank">Michael Nielson and Andy Matuschak's series about Quantum Mechanics</a>.

        I built a <a href="https://github.com/learn-awesome/flashcard" target="_blank">reusable component</a> that allows Web authors
        to embed sets of flashcards (question-answer pairs) within their writing, but that stores users'
        progress in the browser's <code>localStorage</code>. So that anyone can create content in &quot;mnemonic medium&quot; like the 
        above two articles. Authors don't need to <i>write code</i> or use a third-part server, and users
        don't need to <i>download apps</i>. Ideally, I wanted to build simple <code>&lt;card-set&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;flash-card&gt;</code>
        tags - avoiding any need for writing Javascript, but due to
        the limitations of VueJS and WebComponents, this is the best I could do. Improvements are welcome!

        I earlier <a href="https://medium.com/learn-awesome/practice-what-you-learn-using-learnawesome-orgs-flashcards-3343d57a33b0" target="_blank">
        built a FlashCard-module</a> in <a href="https://learnawesome.org" target="_blank">LearnAwesome.org</a> with two features that 
        I think are very cool: (a) A <b>browser-extension that infers the question from the text surrounding the <i>answer</i></b> and lets you 
        quickly create a flashcard about something you want to remember
        from your online reading and (b) <b>a tool that can bulk-create flashcards from your notes</b>, thus helping you remember things from
        non-textual or offline learning: videos, meetings, conferences etc. This new component should make it even more easier for
        online educators to adopt SRS.

    <h2>Demo:</h2>

    <div id="cardset1">
        <card-set></card-set>
    </div>

    <script>
    new Vue({
      el: '#cardset1',
      data: {
        flashCards: [
            {
              qid: 'qid1',
              question: 'When did India become independent?',
              answer: '1947',
              flipped: false,
              answered: null
            }
        ]
      },
      components: {
        'card-set': CardSet
      }
    })
